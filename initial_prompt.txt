My aim is to generate code based on this codebase . So I want you to generate a AGENTS.md file based on this project which will be referenced for code generation . Some important points

1. Please anylyse the codebase thoroughly and lay down the good coding practices
2. Please ensure that unittest are generated in the exatest folder for new functionality added if possible.
3. Have a section for the unittest which lays down the rules for validating the unit test with exact commands based on this codebase 
4. Please take a look at the examples folder for some files from other projects
5. Keep it simple and do not overengineer . The document should be within 200 lines
